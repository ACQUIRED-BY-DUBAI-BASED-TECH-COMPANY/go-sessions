# Fasthttp example

We have only one simple example because the API is the same, the returned session is the same for both net/http and valyala/fasthttp.

## Just append the word "Fasthttp", the rest of the API remains as it's with net/http

`Start` for net/http, `StartFasthttp` for valyala/fasthttp.
`ShiftExpiration` for net/http, `ShiftExpirationFasthttp` for valyala/fasthttp.
`UpdateExpiration` for net/http, `UpdateExpirationFasthttp` for valyala/fasthttp.
`Destroy` for net/http, `DestroyFasthttp` for valyala/fasthttp.
